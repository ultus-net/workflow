# Workflow Interface Design

## Direction

The standalone TUI is exact Cline CLI `3.0.61`'s interactive interface under Workflow supervision, not a Workflow approximation of a coding-agent terminal. Workflow preserves Cline's interaction model and changes only the enforcement seams required for authorization/contained bash plus the home artwork.

## Hierarchy

Cline owns the conversation hierarchy, composer, menus, dialogs, Plan/Act controls, queueing, commands, and mentions. Workflow task/evidence state remains application-owned and must not be reimplemented as presentation state inside Cline.

## Terminal Language

The runnable TUI keeps Cline's terminal rendering and theme behavior. Workflow does not add semantic foreground/background styling; its presentation override is limited to replacing Cline's robot artwork with the Workflow mark.

## Interaction

Cline owns keyboard and interaction behavior. Workflow must not advertise or emulate a parallel subset of Cline's `/` commands, `@` mentions, Plan/Act switching, dialogs, queueing, or cancellation behavior.

## Responsive Behavior

Responsive terminal behavior is upstream Cline behavior. Workflow's patch must not introduce a second layout system.
